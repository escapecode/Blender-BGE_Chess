Using Blender's BGE and modifying the Sunfish chess script, a chess game was created with Blender and Python.  The .blend file is less than 200kb and allows you to play against the computer.

The purpose of this game is to show how easy it is to create games with AI in Blender.

## Requirements
Blender 2.7x since Blender 2.8x removed Blender's internal game engine.

# Documentation

Start Blender 2.7x (preferably from the console to also see a console representation of the 3D Blender game version).  Hover over the 3D window that has the chess board and pieces.  Press P to play, and Esc to end.
